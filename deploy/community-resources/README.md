# MongoDB Search Community Edition

MongoDB Search Community Edition introduces powerful search and vector search capabilities to your
MongoDB on-prem deployment. The `mongot` process runs alongside `mongod` to handle search queries
and index management.

> **Note:** The Community Edition of MongoDB Search is currently in Public Preview. It is available
> for testing and feedback purposes only.
> 
> **Do not use the `mongot` public preview edition for production deployments.**
