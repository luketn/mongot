/**
 * This class is used to manage the commands in a single gRPC stream.
 *
 * <p>Workflow:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>When receiving a command from client, {@code onCommandStart} should be called.
 *   <li>When a command is completed, {@code onCommandComplete} should be called to send server
 *       response.
 *   <li>When receiving a half-close from client, {@code onHalfClosedByClient} should be called.
 *       Server will send half-close after all pending commands are replied.
 *   <li>When the stream is cancelled, {@code onStreamCancellation} should be called. Server will
 *       send half-close after all pending commands are replied. A cleanup callback will be run
 *       after server sending half-close.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Concurrency and Order:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@code onCommandStart}, {@code onHalfClosedByClient} and {@code onStreamCancellation}
 *       should not be called concurrently.
 *   <li>{@code onCommandComplete} can be called concurrently with other methods.
 *   <li>After {@code onHalfClosedByClient} is called, only {@code onCommandComplete} can be called.
 *   <li>After {@code onStreamCancellation} is called, only {@code onCommandComplete} can be called.
 * </ol>
