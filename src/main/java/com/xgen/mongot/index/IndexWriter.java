   * Cancels all running merges and blocks new merges from being scheduled.
   *
   * <p>This method will:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Block new merges from being scheduled
   *   <li>Mark all running merges as aborted
   *   <li>Wait for running merges to stop (with per-thread timeout)
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Note on pending merges:</b> Pending merges (those queued in IndexWriter but not yet
   * started) are not explicitly aborted by this method. However, new merge scheduling is blocked,
   * so no new merge threads will be started. Pending merges will be discarded when the IndexWriter
   * is closed.
   *
   * <p><b>Important Notes:</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><b>Merges remain disabled:</b> After calling this method, merges will remain disabled. To
   *       re-enable merges, the index writer must be reconfigured or recreated.
   *   <li><b>Disk space cleanup:</b> This method does NOT immediately free up disk space consumed
   *       by partial merge files. Aborted merges may leave temporary segment files on disk that
   *       consume up to 1-2X the size of the segments being merged. To reclaim this disk space, you
   *       must call {@link #commit(EncodedUserData)} or {@link #close()} after cancelling merges.
   *       The commit or close operation will trigger cleanup of unreferenced temporary files.
   *   <li><b>Timeout behavior:</b> This method waits for each merge thread with a configurable
   *       per-thread timeout. If a merge thread does not terminate within the timeout, this method
   *       will return while that thread is still running. Callers should NOT assume all merges are
   *       definitely stopped when this method returns. Stuck merges will continue to be tracked in
   *       monitoring metrics (mergeElapsedSeconds) for visibility.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Example usage to reclaim disk space:</b>
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * writer.cancelMerges();
   * writer.commit(EncodedUserData.EMPTY); // Triggers cleanup of partial merge files
   * }</pre>
   *
   * @throws IOException if there is an error during merge cancellation
