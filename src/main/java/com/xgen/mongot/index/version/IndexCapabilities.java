/**
 * An instance of this class defines which optional capabilities are supported for a given index.
 * $vectorSearch and $search indexes may differ in how they index certain types. Moreover, newer
 * $search indexes may support certain optional capabilities depending on when they were created
 * (determined by a combination of IndexFormatVersion and IndexFeatureVersion).
 *
 * <p>This class serves two purposes:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>QueryFactory methods should provide stable method signatures. A reindex or IFV bump should
 *       not entail large cleanup refactorings
 *   <li>QueryFactories should not care if they are operating on search or vector search indexes.
 *       They should only be concerned with whether point/docvalue columns are available.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The set of methods in this interface is expected to shrink after fleet-wide reindexing, and
 * then gradually expand again as we release new features.
