  /**
   * Converts the given FieldPath that is present in the UpdateDescription into the path that should
   * be checked in the IndexDefinition.
   *
   * <p>Simply checking for the exact field path does not work in the presence of arrays. When a
   * field referenced in updatedFields or removedFields has an integer as part of its path (e.g.
   * "a.b.0") we cannot tell if that integer is an index into an array, or simply the name of a
   * field (e.g. { a: { b: { 0: 'my value' } } }).
   *
   * <p>When we receive an update description that references "a.b.0.c" we are unable to precisely
   * say what the schema of the updated document was. The value of "a.b" may be an array or a
   * document. If "a.b" is an array, we should be checking to see if the field "a.b.c" is indexed.
   * If "a.b" is a document, we should be checking to see if the field "a.b.0.c" is indexed.
   *
   * <p>One option for handling this case would be to check for both "a.b.c" and "a.b.0.c", and if
   * either of them is indexed to not filter the event. However, determining the fields we have to
   * check gets complicated when considering arrays of objects with arrays of objects (or even
   * deeper nestings). For "a.b.0.c.1.d" we would need to check "a.b.c.d", "a.b.0.c.d", "a.b.c.1.d",
   * and "a.b.0.c.1.d".
   *
   * <p>Instead of trying to determine exactly which fields need to be checked, we can simplify the
   * problem by considering any path that has an integer child as having been updated completely.
   * For example, if we get the path "a.b.0.c", instead of trying to check for "a.b.c" or "a.b.0.c",
   * simply consider all of "a.b" to have changed, and check if "a.b" is indexed.
   *
   * <p>Note that this relies on the fact that if a field in an embedded document is indexed, all of
   * its ancestors up to the root must also be configured to be indexed. For example, if "a.b.c" is
   * to be indexed as a string, "a.b" and "a" must also be configured to at least be indexed as a
   * document. Additionally, any field whose first matching ancestor is defined as dynamic will be
   * returned with a value from IndexDefinition::getField. That is, if the root mapping is dynamic,
   * "a.b.c" would return as configured to be indexed.
