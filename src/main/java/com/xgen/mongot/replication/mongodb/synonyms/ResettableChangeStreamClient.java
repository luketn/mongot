/**
 * This class represents a {@link ChangeStreamMongoClient} where the initial
 * {@link SynonymMappingHighWaterMark} can be reset after creation to skip ahead in the change
 * stream.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <p>This class creates a {@link ChangeStreamMongoClient} and keeps re-using it for subsequent
 * requests until {@link #reset(SynonymMappingHighWaterMark)} ()} is called. At that time, the
 * delegate client is closed. After a client is closed, the next call to {@link #getNext()} will
 * open a new cursor using the new {@link SynonymMappingHighWaterMark}.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <h3> Why can't we re-use a cursor indefinitely? </h3>
 * Once a change is detected, {@link SynonymMappingManager} will do a full collection scan, which
 * yields a new {@link SynonymMappingHighWaterMark}. We need to close and re-open a new client to
 * skip to the end of the change stream.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <h3> Why not just create a client and kill the cursor after each request?</h3>
 * This works correctly, however, there is a race condition on sharded clusters where mongos returns
 * an empty batch and we kill the cursor while a mongod shard is still working. This creates
 * excessive error messages in mongod logs.
