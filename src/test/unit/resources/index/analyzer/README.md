## Stopword Files
The files ending in `-stopwords.txt` were copied over from the lucene language analyzer packages of 
the language specified in the prefix of the filename. For example, `japanese-analyzer-stopwords.txt` 
contains the stopwords that belong to the `kuromoji` package which is where the `JapaneseAnalyzer` lives. 
In the lucene packages, you will generally find that the stopword file is named as `stopwords.txt`.
